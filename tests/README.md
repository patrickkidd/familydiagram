# Family Diagram CI suite

- models: Data models implementing Qt's MVC framework
- mainwindow: Integration tests combining all other units.
- scene: Data items and drawing them to a QGraphicsScene
- views: Any QWidget/QQuickItem that shows a portion of a data model. Ideally decoupled from app/MainWindow
