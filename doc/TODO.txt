- Manual Testing Ideas:
  - Open via 1) Double click in Finder, 2) drop on Dock icon, 3) Double-click in Windows
    - Stored free license shouldn't open file
  - Load free diagram from appConfig session
  - Save show current date in prefs
  - Import free diagram
  - Init logged in w/ client license, but w/o server clears free diagram
  - Tabular Timeline doesn't update on current date
  - Server updates when logging in 1 / out / in 2
    - Log in as user 1 w/ access rights to user 2's free diagram
    - Observe can see user 2's free diagram
    - Log in as user 2, remove access right
    - log in as user 1, observe user 2's free diagram gone from server view
    - test when user 2's free diagram is last opened file that it closes or doesn't open it after updating access from server
  - App with cached session can recover if user deleted on server.
  - bugsnag_before_notify
- Hitting Escape with pair-bond item mode leaves orphaned pair-bond dragCreateItem

    Because the app is based on Bowen Theory, extra care is taken to separate what is a part of theory and what is not. Substance use would be “content” of emotional “process,” and so does not have a specific feature in the app for it. In fact, the main difference with the genogram is that McGoldrick and Guerin began adding a multitude of symbols for every piece of content that as was requested. The only built-in features in the app pertain to the aspects of emotional process described in Bowen Theory.
    That said, it is still useful to keep track of the content of emotional process and to somehow illustrate it in presentations. That was Layers are for. Layers allow you to make content-oriented annotations on the diagram in a way that is separate from the data of emotional process required by theory. You can add any number of layers that function like powerpoint slides in a presentation. For people, Color is a property stored in a layer and can be found in the Meta tab when you inspect a person. To set color, you have to add a layer to the diagram and click the Active checkbox. Then just inspect the person and set the color under the meta tab. A Color for that person is then stored in that Layer and is visible whenever the layer is active. Clicking the Reset Diagram button in the top toolbar deactivates all layers and hides all meta properties.

- Allow operating system to handle saving changes to documents as in Pages.
- Add date bookmarks, bookmark menu to main app menu.
- Clean up orphaned files function (some files may exist for people who don't exist?).
- Add ctrl-click for multi-select layers.
- Add duplicate layer action, or maybe copy|paste later data.
- How to link relationships to events timeline? Cycling through events can skip relationship shifts.
- Add place detection to Events.
- Prioritize showing nodal events in visual timeline.
- Autosave
- Item descriptors (shift symbols)
  - Dotted person pen for differentiation level
    - "Defined self" as dashed lines of increased interval
    - Automatically scale dash length based on overall shifts up and down in person.
  - Fill color/saturation for anxiety
  - blur / jagged lines for something else
  - Arrow overlay on emotional process symbol for direction
  - Need 'distance' symbol for one person to group (slash toward people?)
- Sort tags on rename tag
- Set icon for file from scene rendering

- Find a way to enforce relative event order. More important than precise dates.
  - Maybe enforce a mix of drag-order and dates?
- Add tag/date search to personal history.
- Consolidate add|edit event|emotion properties
- Redundant setTextWidth in Callout.onText?
- Set 'One moment...' dialog to show after timeout?
  - this dialog is annoying, anyway


WISHLIST
===============================================
- Events
  - Add photos/video for family collections.
  - Find a way to show "fuzzy" date ranges (add estimated end-date)
    - Allow just year, just year+month, or season+year.
  - Think about necessity of "unsure" for relative order.
  - Display anxiety shade on anxiety shift.
- Items
  - Add photos with dates
  - Think of some way to show frequency of contact between people.
  - Ecomap-ish symbols to account for extra-familial relationships
- iPad/Apple Pencil
  - Handwritting recognition!
    - Allow drawing in males and females.
    - Allow writing in QLineEdit.
  - Check event order for jagged lines
  - Splining (QSplineSeries/SplineChartItem, stackoverflow)
  - Feedback indicating pencil strokes are associated with person when person selected
  - eraser
    - paint eraser path
    - highlight intersected strokes
    - delete strokes on release
- Review PDF expert for scene toolbar examples
- Files
  - Share file to collaborate with others (no idea how to implement)
  - Import/export selection to excel for working on planes
  - Collaboration between client & coach
    - Powerful considering free status of app
    - Will help propagate the app
- EHR
  - Core Principle: Keep it centered on the family
    - Don't get sucked into full-blown bloated EHR project unless compatible with family theory
  - Sharing multiple families together - Social? Business? School?


Videos
==========================================
- Use tags
- Navigation: pinch-zoom|alt-drag|alt-zoom|callout anchor-drag.


OPTIMIZATION
------------------------------------------
- Move emotion painting to _cutils, especially Jig
- Optimize copy/paste, import
  - Import should not duplicate imported items to paste
  - Clipboard.copy should not have to clone+remap items to determine if they should be copied?
    - Currently has to call Scene.deregister, which is overkill...
  - Refactor Clipboard.__init__|copy to single method?




Test Protocol
==========================================
- Check for deleted objects; avoid memory leaks
- Double-tap hotspot
- Test on older macOS


RELEASE STEPS
==========================================
- update version.VERSION_*
- verify version.VERSION_COMPAT
- build osx-release
- update server source
