# Event Flattening Refactor - Master TODO

**Goal:** Make Events top-level Scene objects instead of children of Person/Marriage/Emotion, simplifying the object hierarchy and enabling better timeline/event management.

**Status:** In progress (progress commit: 235dc569)

**Archive:** Completed phases moved to [FLATTEN_EVENTS_DONE.md](./FLATTEN_EVENTS_DONE.md)

## üö® QUICK START - Critical Path

**Priority order:** Phase 7 ‚Üí 13 ‚Üí 14

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix remaining test failures (Phase 7)
2. Polish and release (Phases 13, 14)

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Phases 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.0, 7.2, 8, 9, 10, 10.5, 11, 15 (see [FLATTEN_EVENTS_DONE.md](./FLATTEN_EVENTS_DONE.md))

**Estimated Effort Remaining:**
- Phase 7: 4 hours (test fixes)
- Phase 13: 1 hour (documentation)
- Phase 14: 2 hours (version bump)
- **Total: ~7 hours of focused work**

**Testing Strategy:**
After each phase:
1. Run unit tests: `python -m pytest tests/scene/test_event.py -v`
2. Run model tests: `python -m pytest tests/models/ -v`
3. Run integration tests: `python -m pytest tests/views/ -v`
4. Smoke test UI: Open app, create events, timeline, undo/redo

Before final commit:
1. Full test suite: `python -m pytest -vv`
2. Load old diagram files (test compat.py)
3. Create new diagram, save, reload
4. Test all event types
5. Test timeline interactions
6. Test undo/redo thoroughly




## PHASE 11: Commands/Undo ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed - See [FLATTEN_EVENTS_DONE.md](./FLATTEN_EVENTS_DONE.md#phase-11-commandsundo--completed) for full details.

**Summary:**
- Updated RemoveItems command to work with Scene-owned events
- Fixed event/emotion mapping to use IDs instead of object references
- Updated person deletion logic to delete associated events/emotions
- Fixed restoration order (events after people, emotions after events)
- Updated Person/Marriage to use Scene query methods (eventsFor, emotionsFor)
- Created comprehensive test suite (96 tests across 7 files) covering all RemoveItems scenarios

**Next Phase:** Phase 7 (Test Fixes)

---

## PHASE 7: Test Fixes üü°

Update tests to work with new Event structure.

### 7.1 Fix Event() Constructor Calls
**Files Changed (from git diff):**
- tests/scene/test_event.py (77 lines changed)
- tests/scene/test_marriage.py (81 lines deleted - needs investigation)
- tests/views/eventform/*.py (multiple files)
- tests/views/test_emotionproperties.py (8 lines changed)
- tests/views/test_marriageproperties.py (185 lines changed)
- tests/models/test_copilotengine.py (8 lines changed)
- tests/models/test_searchmodel.py (3 lines changed)
- tests/models/test_timelinemodel.py (26 lines changed)

**Old Pattern:**
```python
event = Event(person)  # FAILS: missing kind argument
```

**New Pattern (from test_event.py:10):**
```python
event = Event(EventKind.Shift, person)  # Positional
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] tests/scene/test_event.py - update all Event() calls (mostly done, check line 24 logic error)
- [ ] tests/scene/test_marriage.py - 81 lines deleted, verify tests still valid
- [ ] tests/views/eventform/ - 6 test files with Event() calls
- [ ] tests/views/test_emotionproperties.py - update Event() calls
- [ ] tests/views/test_marriageproperties.py - 185 lines changed, needs review
- [ ] tests/models/*.py - update Event() calls in model tests
- [ ] Search for remaining `Event\(` patterns and update

**Known Logic Error:**
**File:** tests/scene/test_event.py:24
```python
# Line 21-33 - LOGIC ERROR
event = Event(EventKind.Shift, personB)  # ‚Üê Event added to personB
event.setPerson(personB, undo=undo)  # ‚Üê Still personB! Not personA!
assert event in personA.events()  # ‚Üê WRONG: event is still in personB
assert event not in personB.events()  # ‚Üê WRONG: should be in personB
```

Should probably be:
```python
event = Event(EventKind.Shift, personA)  # Start with personA
event.setPerson(personB, undo=undo)  # Switch to personB
assert event not in personA.events()  # No longer in personA
assert event in personB.events()  # Now in personB
```

---

### 7.3 Fix Emotion Construction
**Files with Emotion() calls (from grep):**
- pkdiagram/scene/scene.py
- pkdiagram/scene/emotions.py
- tests/views/eventform/test_edit.py
- tests/views/test_emotionproperties.py
- tests/scene/test_scene_add_remove.py
- tests/models/test_timelinemodel.py
- tests/models/test_searchmodel.py
- pkdiagram/scene/commands.py
- tests/test_documentview.py
- tests/mainwindow/test_mw_kb_shortcuts.py
- tests/scene/test_scene_show_hide.py
- tests/scene/test_scene_read_write.py
- tests/scene/test_emotions.py

**Old Pattern:**
```python
emotion = Emotion(kind=RelationshipKind.Conflict, ...)  # Missing event?
```

**New Pattern (from scene.py:720):**
```python
# Scene.read() pattern:
kind = Emotion.kindForKindSlug(chunk["kind"])
item = Emotion(kind=kind, target=None, event=None)  # Placeholder values

# Test pattern:
event = Event(
    kind=EventKind.Shift,
    person=person1,
    relationshipTargets=[person2],
)
scene.addItem(event)

emotion = Emotion(event=event, target=person2, kind=RelationshipKind.Conflict)
scene.addItem(emotion)
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Update all Emotion() calls in tests to include `event=` and `target=`
- [ ] Create corresponding Event objects for dated emotions
- [ ] For undated emotions (manual drawing), use event=None
- [ ] Add both event and emotion to scene explicitly
- [ ] Verify scene.py:720 Emotion loading works with event=None placeholder
- [ ] Test undo/redo for commands.AddItem

### 7.4 Graphical Timeline Tests
- [ ] Add prelim test suite
- [ ] Test rendering with events that have date ranges
- [ ] Ensure selecting an end marker selects the underlying Event


---

### 7.5 Run Full Test Suite and Fix Failures
**Action Items:**
- [ ] Run `python -m pytest -vv` and collect all failures
- [ ] Fix test failures by category (Event, Emotion, Marriage, Scene, etc.)
- [ ] Verify Scene.read()/write() tests pass after Phase 0.2/0.3 implemented
- [ ] Verify compat.py tests pass after Phase 6 implemented
- [ ] Verify clone/paste tests pass after Phase 12 implemented
- [ ] Verify age calculation still works (should read from personModel.birthDateTime)

---

## PHASE 13: Edge Cases & Polish üü¢

### 13.1 Handle Orphaned Events
**Scenario:** Event.person is deleted

**Current Behavior:** ?

**Desired Behavior:**
- Option A: Delete event when person is deleted
- Option B: Allow orphaned events, show as "(deleted person)"

**Action Items:**
- [ ] **DECIDE:** Delete orphaned events or allow them?
- [ ] Implement chosen behavior in RemoveItems command
- [ ] Add tests for orphaned events

---

### 13.2 Handle Marriage Events
**Question:** How does Event.person work for Marriage events?

**Current Code:** Marriage events set `event.person = marriage`

**Is this correct?** Or should they:
- Set `event.spouse` to one spouse and leave `event.person` empty?
- Have a separate `event.marriage` field?

**Action Items:**
- [ ] **CLARIFY:** How should marriage events reference the marriage?
- [ ] Document the pattern in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Ensure consistency across codebase

---

### 13.3 Event Validation
**Add validation to catch errors early:**

```python
def Event.validate(self):
    """Ensure event fields match its kind."""
    if self.kind() in (EventKind.Bonded, EventKind.Married, EventKind.Separated,
                       EventKind.Divorced, EventKind.Moved):
        assert self.spouse(), f"{self.kind()} requires spouse"
        assert not self.relationshipTargets(), f"{self.kind()} cannot have targets"

    elif self.kind() in (EventKind.Birth, EventKind.Adopted):
        assert self.spouse(), f"{self.kind()} requires spouse (other parent)"
        assert self.child(), f"{self.kind()} requires child"

    elif self.kind() == EventKind.Shift:
        if self.relationship():  # R variable
            assert self.relationshipTargets(), "Relationship shift requires targets"
        else:  # S, A, or F variable
            assert not self.relationshipTargets(), "Non-relationship shift cannot have targets"

    elif self.kind() == EventKind.Death:
        assert self.person, "Death requires person"
        assert not self.spouse(), "Death cannot have spouse field"
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Add `Event.validate()` method
- [ ] Call during Event.write() or in tests
- [ ] Add tests for invalid events

---

## PHASE 13: Documentation üìù

### 13.1 Update CLAUDE.md
**Status:** ‚úÖ Already updated with architecture notes

**Remaining:**
- [ ] Add Event.kind validation rules
- [ ] Document Event-Emotion relationship
- [ ] Document TimelineRow pattern

---

### 13.2 Add Architecture Diagram
**Create:** Visual diagram showing:
- Scene owns Events, People, Marriages, Emotions
- Events reference Person via `event.person`
- Emotions reference Event via `emotion.event`
- Emotions reference target Person via `emotion.target`

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create architecture diagram (ASCII or image)
- [ ] Add to doc/FLATTENING_EVENTS.md or CLAUDE.md

---

## PHASE 14: File Format Version Bump üî¥ CRITICAL

**Purpose:** The event flattening refactor introduces breaking changes to the file format. Files saved in the new format cannot be opened by older versions.

### 14.1 Update VERSION_COMPAT
**File:** `pkdiagram/version.py`

**Current Values (need to check):**
```python
VERSION = "2.0.12"  # Current release version
VERSION_COMPAT = "2.0.0"  # Oldest version that can read this file format
```

**Required Change:**
When the new format is released, bump `VERSION_COMPAT` to prevent older versions from trying to open incompatible files:
```python
VERSION = "2.1.0"  # New version with flattened events
VERSION_COMPAT = "2.1.0"  # Files created with 2.1.0+ cannot be opened by 2.0.x
```

**Rationale:**
- Old versions (2.0.x) expect events in `data["items"]` nested under people/marriages/emotions
- New version (2.1.0) writes events to `data["events"]` as top-level items
- Old versions will crash trying to load new files if we don't block them

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Check current VERSION and VERSION_COMPAT in version.py
- [ ] Decide on version number for flattened events release (2.1.0 or 3.0.0?)
- [ ] Update VERSION_COMPAT when deploying new format
- [ ] Add migration guide to release notes

---

### 14.2 Add Migration Test Cases
**File:** `tests/scene/test_compat.py` (or new test file)

**Purpose:** Verify that old file format can be loaded and migrated by compat.py.

**Test Cases Needed:**
```python
def test_migrate_old_person_events_to_scene():
    """Test that Person.events are migrated to Scene.events."""
    old_data = {
        "version": "2.0.12",
        "people": [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "events": [  # OLD: events nested under person
                    {"id": 10, "uniqueId": "birth", "dateTime": "..."}
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    compat.update_data(old_data)
    assert old_data.get("events") == [  # NEW: events at top level
        {"id": 10, "kind": EventKind.Birth.value, "person": 1, "dateTime": "..."}
    ]
    assert "events" not in old_data["people"][0]  # Removed from person

def test_migrate_emotion_start_end_events_to_single_event():
    """Test Emotion.startEvent/endEvent merged into single Event with endDateTime."""
    old_data = {
        "emotions": [
            {
                "id": 20,
                "startEvent": {"id": 30, "dateTime": "2020-01-01"},
                "endEvent": {"id": 31, "dateTime": "2020-12-31"},
                "person_a": 1,
                "person_b": 2,
            }
        ]
    }
    compat.update_data(old_data)
    assert old_data.get("events") == [
        {
            "id": 30,
            "kind": EventKind.Shift.value,
            "person": 1,
            "dateTime": "2020-01-01",
            "endDateTime": "2020-12-31",
            "relationshipTargets": [2],
        }
    ]
    assert old_data["emotions"][0]["event"] == 30  # References event ID
    assert "startEvent" not in old_data["emotions"][0]
    assert "endEvent" not in old_data["emotions"][0]

def test_migrate_uniqueId_to_kind():
    """Test Event.uniqueId string ‚Üí Event.kind enum."""
    old_data = {
        "events": [
            {"id": 10, "uniqueId": "birth"},
            {"id": 11, "uniqueId": "CustomIndividual"},  # Edge case
        ]
    }
    compat.update_data(old_data)
    assert old_data["events"][0]["kind"] == EventKind.Birth.value
    assert old_data["events"][1]["kind"] == EventKind.Shift.value
    assert "uniqueId" not in old_data["events"][0]
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create comprehensive test cases for compat.py migrations
- [ ] Test loading actual saved diagram files from version 2.0.x
- [ ] Verify round-trip: old format ‚Üí migrate ‚Üí save ‚Üí load ‚Üí works
- [ ] Test edge cases: empty events, None uniqueId, missing fields

---

### 14.3 Backward Compatibility Strategy
**Question:** Should new version be able to SAVE in old format for compatibility?

**Option A: One-way upgrade (RECOMMENDED)**
- New version can READ old format (via compat.py)
- New version always SAVES in new format
- Users cannot downgrade after upgrading
- Simpler implementation

**Option B: Dual-format support**
- New version can READ and WRITE both formats
- "Save As..." dialog lets user choose format
- More complex, requires maintaining two code paths

**Recommendation:** Use Option A (one-way upgrade) because:
- Event flattening is fundamental architecture change
- Maintaining dual format is complex and error-prone
- VERSION_COMPAT will block old versions from opening new files
- Users can keep old version installed if needed

**Action Items:**
- [ ] **DECIDE:** One-way upgrade vs dual-format support
- [ ] Document upgrade path in release notes
- [ ] Warn users to backup files before upgrading
- [ ] Consider "Export to 2.0.x format" feature for emergencies

10. ‚úÖ TimelineModel phantom events - **Addressed in Phase 3** (archived)

---

## APPENDIX: User Decisions & Clarifications

### From Follow-up Discussion:

**#1: Remove Caches**
- ‚úÖ CONFIRMED: Remove Person._events, Marriage._events, Emotion._event caches
- ‚úÖ Use computed properties querying Scene
- Performance negligible per user

**#2: Event Change Notifications**
- ‚úÖ DECIDED: Use direct callbacks (onEventAdded/onEventRemoved/onEventChanged)
- ‚úÖ NOT using Qt signals
- Scene calls person.onEventAdded() when event.person is set

**#3: Event Person Fields**
- ‚úÖ CONFIRMED: Keep categorical fields (spouse, child, relationshipTargets, relationshipTriangles)
- ‚úÖ They serve different semantic purposes per EventKind
- See updated requirements table in Phase 5 based on CLAUDE.md

**#4: TimelineModel Dummy Events**
- ‚úÖ DECIDED: Use TimelineRow dataclass (Option 1)
- Clean separation of view from model
- See Phase 3

**#5: Emotion-Event Relationship**
- ‚úÖ DECIDED: Use Option 1 (Emotion owns Event reference)
- Remove Event.emotions() factory
- Explicit creation: create Event, then create Emotion(s) referencing it
- See Phase 4
